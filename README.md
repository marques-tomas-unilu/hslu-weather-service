# Weather Data Application (WDA)

This repository contains the **Weather Data Application (WDA)**, a software project developed as a **group assignment** during an **exchange semester** at **Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU), Computer Science**.

The project was implemented by **Group g01** as part of the **Software Design and Engineering (SWDE)** module in the **Fall Semester 2024**.

## Project Overview

The Weather Data Application is a software system designed to **collect, process, and manage weather-related data**.  
Its main purpose is to demonstrate the design and implementation of a data-driven application using modern software engineering principles.

The application is capable of:
- Retrieving weather data from external sources
- Storing and managing weather measurements
- Processing and aggregating weather information
- Providing structured access to weather data for further use or analysis

The focus of this project lies on **clean architecture, modular design, and maintainability**, rather than on being a production-ready weather service.
